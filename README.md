## Project Overview

This project is a simple yet functional FM radio receiver built using an ESP12E microcontroller and the RDA5807M FM module. It allows for station switching and volume control via a button interface. The radio is powered by a Li-Ion battery and uses a TP4056 module for charging. The audio output is amplified by a PAM8403 module and delivered through a 10-watt speaker.

## Features

- **Station Switching**: Cycle through 10 preset FM stations.
- **Volume Control**: Fixed volume level, adjustable in the code.
- **Portable Power**: Powered by a rechargeable Li-Ion battery.
- **Amplified Audio**: Clear audio output through a 10-watt speaker.

## Hardware Components

- **ESP12E**: The core microcontroller for processing and control.
- **RDA5807M**: FM receiver module.
- **Li-Ion Battery**: Portable power source.
- **TP4056**: Battery charging and protection module.
- **PAM8403**: Amplifier module for the audio output.
- **Telescopic Antenna**: For improved FM signal reception.
- **10-Watt Speaker**: Outputs the radio audio.
